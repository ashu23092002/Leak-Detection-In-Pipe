# **Leak Detection using vibrational analysis of **

Simulated model of pipe with leaks in MATLAB and plotted pressure and flow rate variation with leak size. <br>
Dataset of Leak Simulations in Experimental Testbed Water Distribution System:[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tbrnp6vrnj/1#:~:text=This%20dataset%20includes%20two%20hundred,152.4%20mm%20diameter%20PVC%20pipes.]


## **To-Do List**
- [x] Fix Codespace No such file error
- [x] Convert accelerometer data to fft analyzed samples and store it in pandas.dataFrame
- [x] Fixed Jupyter java error for command '%matplotlib widget' within the notebook
- [ ] Create a interactive slider to witch between different fft plots for a case
